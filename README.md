# Maripose
Old-timey music font.

This font was inspired by, and strives to match the aesthetic of, publications by the Southern Methodist Publishing House of Nashville, Tennessee from the period around 1878-1889. A selection of their publications have been preserved on archive.org at the link here: [https://archive.org/search.php?query=creator%3A%22McIntosh%2C+R.+M.%22].

Maripose is a [SMuFL](https://www.smufl.org/) font and can be used in any music layout software that's compatible with SMuFL.
